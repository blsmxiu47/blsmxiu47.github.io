# WarriWes Data Analytics



I've decided to pick up work on my Data Analytics Portfolio{link} where I left off last year
with a new and improved version.

This portfolio will include more explanation behind the code
and will try to focus on projects with even more relevent applications, in addition to a regular
blog feature that will serve as a discussion of current projects in addition to general
commentary on 'data science' in general.



Now that I've gotten a chance to work as a data analyst at a company that handles a ton of data
I have some new perspective on what it means to 'work in data'. 

I certainly think that what we refer broadly to as 'ML' and 'AI' (two different concepts, btw) 
is interesting and if I had to pick I'd say my true passions lay in the fields of natural language 
processing and computational linguistics, however I imagine the majority of work as part of this 
blog will be in *analysis*, EDA, data collection and mining, SQL querying, and most importantly, 
interpretting results and understanding what the data and relationships we've dissected actually 
mean (for, say, a given corporation or client).



My guess is that I won't be able to help myself adding some pretty bells 
and whistles to visualizations, posting a deep learning project here and there, just cuz that's 
what I call fun, but the serious focus will be on providing useful examples of what MOST data 
scientists and analysts tend to do on a daily basis, at least at first ;)
